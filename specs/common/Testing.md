# Testing Specification

## Scope
Tests are derived from specification function points using these principles.

## Technical Requirements
- Use pytest testing framework with coverage reporting (pytest-cov)
- Always report coverage statistics during test runs
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Follow established testing patterns
- Provide batch files for easy development workflow (run_unit_tests.bat, run_e2e_tests.bat)

## Function Points

### Unit Tests
**Purpose**: One test class per component covering all public interfaces with appropriate mocking
**Inputs**: Production classes, mocked dependencies
**Processing**: 
- Function Point Coverage: Every capability in specs gets corresponding test scenarios
- Fast Execution: Use small, focused test data sets
- Isolated Testing: Mock external dependencies (database, filesystem, APIs)
- Helper Functions: Reduce repetition with reusable test utilities
- Skip Simple Data Models: Don't test basic data classes/models that only hold data without logic
**Outputs**: Pass/fail results with detailed failure information

### End-to-End Tests
**Purpose**: Exercise major user workflows with as few tests as possible
**Inputs**: Command arguments, actual executable/module
**Processing**:
- Major Flow Coverage: As few tests as possible while covering all major user journeys
- Integration Verification: Components working together through actual interfaces
- No Mocking: Test the actual executable/module as users would experience it
- Each test represents a distinct user workflow
**Outputs**: Verified complete workflows with expected results

### Test Data Strategy
**Purpose**: Provide consistent test data creation utilities with representative complexity
**Inputs**: Test scenario requirements
**Processing**:
- Small and Fast: Even end-to-end tests use minimal data sets for quick execution
- Representative Complexity: Include key scenarios like track variations, missing matches, playlist hierarchies
- Deterministic: Consistent results across test runs and environments
**Outputs**: Reusable test data creation methods

### What NOT to Test
**Purpose**: Focus testing effort on valuable areas and avoid testing overhead
**Skip These Areas**:
- Simple Data Models: Basic dataclasses, NamedTuples, or simple classes that only hold data
- Property Getters/Setters: Unless they contain validation logic
- Framework Code: Don't test Click CLI decorators, pytest fixtures, or other framework functionality
- Constructor Assignment: Don't test that constructor parameters are assigned to instance variables
- String Representations: Don't test __str__ or __repr__ unless they contain complex formatting logic
**Focus Instead On**: Business logic, data transformations, error handling, integration points
