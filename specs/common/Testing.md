# Testing Specification

## Scope
Tests are derived from specification function points using these principles.

## Technical Requirements
- Use pytest testing framework
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Follow established testing patterns

## Function Points

### Unit Tests
**Purpose**: One test class per component covering all public interfaces with appropriate mocking
**Inputs**: Production classes, mocked dependencies
**Processing**: 
- Function Point Coverage: Every capability in specs gets corresponding test scenarios
- Fast Execution: Use small, focused test data sets
- Isolated Testing: Mock external dependencies (database, filesystem, APIs)
**Outputs**: Pass/fail results with detailed failure information

### End-to-End Tests
**Purpose**: Test the full application with realistic but small data sets
**Inputs**: Small test data sets, various command arguments
**Processing**:
- Complete Workflows: Test the full application with realistic but small data sets
- Integration Verification: Components working together through actual interfaces
- Performance Validation: Ensure acceptable performance with test-sized data sets
- Error Scenarios: Test failure modes and recovery behavior
**Outputs**: Verified complete workflows with expected results

### Test Data Strategy
**Purpose**: Provide consistent test data creation utilities with representative complexity
**Inputs**: Test scenario requirements
**Processing**:
- Small and Fast: Even end-to-end tests use minimal data sets for quick execution
- Representative Complexity: Include key scenarios like track variations, missing matches, playlist hierarchies
- Deterministic: Consistent results across test runs and environments
**Outputs**: Reusable test data creation methods
