# Build and Development Workflow Specification

## Scope
Define the development workflow, build process, and quality assurance tools for local development and CI/CD integration.

## Out of Scope
- Cross-platform build system (Makefile, Python build scripts, nox)

## Technical Requirements
- **Build System**: pyproject.toml with editable installation for development
- **Quality Tools**: Integrated linting, type checking, and testing
- **Development Scripts**: Batch files for common development tasks

## Function Points

### Development Setup
- **Installation**: `pip install -e .` for editable development installation
- **Dependencies**: All development dependencies specified in pyproject.toml
- **Configuration Files**: `.flake8` for linting configuration, `.pylintrc` for static analysis

### Build Process
- **Clean Installation**: Remove previous builds and reinstall package
- **Dependency Resolution**: Install all runtime and development dependencies
- **Quality Checks**: Run all code quality tools before considering build successful

### Quality Assurance Tools
- **Code Style**: flake8 with 100-character line length limit
- **Static Analysis**: pylint with development-friendly configuration (allow TODO comments)
- **Type Checking**: mypy for static type checking
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage reporting

### Development Scripts
- **build.bat**: Complete build with dependency installation and quality checks
- **unit_tests.bat**: Unit test execution with coverage reporting  
- **e2e_tests.bat**: End-to-end test execution

### Configuration Files Required
- **.flake8**: Line length and style configuration
- **.pylintrc**: Static analysis configuration for development workflow
- **pyproject.toml**: All dependencies, build configuration, and tool settings

## Build Script Flow
1. Display build start message
2. Install package in editable mode with all dependencies
3. Run flake8 code style checks
4. Run pylint static analysis  
5. Run mypy type checking
6. Indicate successful completion or exit with error code

## Quality Standards
- All quality checks must pass for build to be considered successful
- Exit codes must be properly propagated for CI/CD integration
- Clear error messages and progress indication during build process
