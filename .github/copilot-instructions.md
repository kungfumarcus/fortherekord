# AI Instructions

Development guidelines for AI assistants working on this project

**IMPORTANT: THESE INSTRUCTIONS TAKE PRIORITY AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE FOLLOWED**

* **Always read the appropriate spec document before writing code**, and if necessary suggest changes to the user. Always implement the code according to the spec.
* **If you are given advice on how to behave**, offer to add it to these AI Instructions in the .github\copilot-instructions.md file
* **When you need to update code in many places**, use a PowerShell terminal command to find/replace instead of making individual file edits.
* **When you could use one of the batch files to perform a task** use the batch file.
* **Prefer to use the *.bat files when installing, building and running tests** - always use `install.bat`, `build.bat`, `unit_test.bat`, etc. instead of direct commands.
* **READ THE FOLLOWING FILES** if you have not have them in your context:
  * `README.md`
  * `specs/common/*.md`
* **When you change your plans**, stop making changes and ask for  clarification.
